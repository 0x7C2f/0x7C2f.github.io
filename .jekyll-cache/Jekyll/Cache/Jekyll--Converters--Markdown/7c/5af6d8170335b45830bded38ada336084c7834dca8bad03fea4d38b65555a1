<p>I have added my dotfiles to the repo, and successful proved (to myself) that I can both update my dotfiles on my system, as well as update them website (as a page entry). With that being said, I just need to create the pages for each file and then the site will have my current setup for all! I will be adding an ansible-pull link reference soon.</p>
