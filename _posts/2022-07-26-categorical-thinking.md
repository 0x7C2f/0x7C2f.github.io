# Categorical Thinking

---

"Human beings are categorization machines, taking in voluminous amounts of messy data and then simplifying and structuring it. Thatâ€™s how we make sense of the world and communicate our ideas to others. But according to the authors, categorization comes so naturally to us that we often see categories where none exist. That warps our view of the world and harms." - [hbr.org](https://hbr.org/2019/09/the-dangers-of-categorical-thinking)
