# My Categorical Nightmare

---

"Human beings are categorization machines, taking in voluminous amounts of messy data and then simplifying and structuring it. Thatâ€™s how we make sense of the world and communicate our ideas to others. But according to the authors, categorization comes so naturally to us that we often see categories where none exist." - [hbr.org](https://hbr.org/2019/09/the-dangers-of-categorical-thinking)

I find this all too real. For example, I am current working on setting up my dotfiles with [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/), and a feature of [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) lets you divide your workflow into what are known as "[roles](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_reuse_roles.html)". While these roles are supposidly suppose to help you will simplifying your workflow while organizing, I find myself focusing more on how to divide these roles rather than actually setting up a functional workflow.
