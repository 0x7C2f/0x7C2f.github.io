# So I jacked up my phone again...

I found a new patching application (outside of lucky patcher) named NFG. Turns out NFG is not compatible with the new LPosed framework even though it's literally a fork of Xposed. To top it off, NFG targets Android 10 and lower. Well...I guess serves me right for thinking it'll all be fine lol Time to wipe my phone!
