title: 'TIL: set -e'

From ``` help set ```:

*"e Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status."*

But it's considered bad practice by some (bash FAQ and irc freenode #bash FAQ authors).

It's recommended to use:

```trap 'do_something' ERR```

to run do_something function when errors occur.
