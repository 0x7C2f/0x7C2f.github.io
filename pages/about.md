# About Me

Greetings, fellow wanderer of the digital ether. I'm a curious soul delving into the intersections of code, commerce, and consciousness. By day, I wrestle with algorithms and architectures in the realm of programming; by night, I ponder the machinations of economics and the profound questions of philosophy.

This site serves as my digital library and thought repository. Here, you'll find a curated collection of PDFs spanning programming manuals, economic treatises, and explorations into conspiracy theories—because knowledge knows no bounds, and sometimes the rabbit hole is where the real insights lie.

Feel free to browse, download, and engage. If something sparks your interest, drop a line.
